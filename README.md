# energize_andover
This application parses energy consumption logs generated by the Metasys application.  Those logs are formatted in a way that makes analysis tricky -- each measurement is printed on a separate row.  This application reformats a log file into a standard csv, in which each row corresponds to all measurements at a particular time.

The application can be run in two ways, via a command line script and by using the online interface.

## Running in the command line
The parsing script is `energize_andover/script/parse.py`.  It works as a standalone python application that can be invoked via command line, with syntax that can be viewed by typing `python energize_andover/script/parse.py -h`.

Here is an example of how it could be used:
```bash
python script/parse.py -i "data/AHS-ElectricTrend-Nov_Dec2015.csv" -o output.csv -s --start 17:00 --end 8:00 -c "data/columns.txt"
```

## Online interface
This repository is really a django project with a form that can be used to interact with the script.  The form supports upload of a raw Metasys log and returns a parsed version.
